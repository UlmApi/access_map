<h4>What is the Access-Map?</h4>

The Access Map was originally created by the initiative <a href="http://mappable.info">Mappable</a> from Hamburg. The idea:

<blockquote>Taking the tube or suburban railway for your daily commute is quite comfortable if you live in a city with a well developed public transport network. But as so often in life we quickly take things for granted and tend to forget that such amenities are not accessible for everyone. [...] Fortunately there are projects like Raul Krauthausen's phenomenal <a href="http://wheelmap.org/en/">wheelmap</a> [...] While this and other tools help to improve the situation of handicapped people, we nevertheless think that from time to time it's useful and necessary to remind 'the public' about the limitations of 'public transport'.</blockquote>

<p>So - Apps that support people with mobility restrictions in their everyday life are great - but they are not the final answer to the underlying problem that needs to be solved, namely too few accesible stations. With this map we want to create more visibility for the topic, by visualizing how a city looks like for a person in a wheelchair.<br>
We strongly encourage you to redploy this tool in your city. It's really easy and no coding skills are needed. We'll explain how to do that below.<p>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>

<p>This Readme explains step by step how to redeploy the Access Map in your city.</p>

<b>1. Find a map</b>

<p>First you need to chose a map for the visualization. Of course it makes sense to use the public transportation map by your city, but often these underlie copyright restrictions. You could ask for permission or check whether there is a free version available. This can be quite a hassle, decide for yourself, how you want to proceed on that.</p>

<b>2. Edit the map</b>

<p>This is probably the part that consumes most of the time - which isn't much though. Make a copy of whatever map image you want to use and rename it for example map_erased. Open it in a editing program and erase all the stations that are not accessible. I used </p>

2. Edit the map 
3. Set up a github account 
4. clone the repository 
5. Adjust to your city 
	- edit the index file 
	- replace the images (maybe download github app or on your terminal)
6. You can check whether it's working locally with python 
7. Push
8. Done
